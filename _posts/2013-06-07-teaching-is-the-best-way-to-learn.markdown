title: Teaching Is The Best Way To Learn
location: Clermont-Fd Area, France
---

Earlier this year, I gave lectures to undergraduate students at IUT de
Clermont-Fd (France). I taught **web development** using PHP as media
([slides](http://licpro.williamdurand.fr/php-slides/) &
[sources](https://github.com/licpro/php-slides)), and **security**, mainly
focused on Web/APIs security
([slides](http://licpro.williamdurand.fr/security-slides/)
& [sources](https://github.com/licpro/security-slides)).

I introduced not only best practices in web development, but tools such as
[Git](http://git-scm.com), [Vim](http://www.vim.org/),
[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com),
[Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com), and [GitHub](http://github.com).
Each student worked on a [Virtual Machine](http://github.com/licpro/php-vm),
so that they could do whatever they wanted. Except a few weird issues, that was
really interesting because pushing updates, from my point of view, was really
easy. The workflow was pretty straightforward, they all started by running
`git pull && vagrant up` and that was it!

Students wrote their own micro-framework in PHP relying on components such as
the [Symfony2](http://symfony.com) ones and managed thanks to
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org). They wrote unit tests, and functional tests
too. Some published their code on GitHub, and most of them did a great job by
building a web application combined to a _true_ REST API, serving content in the
best format for the clients.

As for the [security lectures](http://licpro.williamdurand.fr/security-slides/),
I tried to give an overview of well-known security topics, including
**authorization**, **authentication**, some **authentication mechanisms**, and
how to **secure the web**.

That was a really great experience! I learnt quite a few tips on how to be better
at teaching. I use to talk to skilled people, my vocabulary is really technical,
and that was the first thing I had to change while explaining something to
students. They never did web development before. Introducing high-level
concepts using simple words is not easy, but it is a really good exercise for
those who want to improve their communication skills.
Also, as I needed to be able to answer various questions, I had to know my
topics by heart, including how things worked under the hood. So I studied a lot
to be better while performing.

I got positive feedback from students, and that was cool as it was my first year
as teacher. I enjoyed teaching things that took me a few years to learn.

Actually, I think **I open sourced my knowledge**.
